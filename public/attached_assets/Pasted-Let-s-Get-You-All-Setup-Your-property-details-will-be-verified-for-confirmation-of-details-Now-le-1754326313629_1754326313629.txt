Then I would like to create a contact form for the client 
Payee Name:	First Name	Last Name
Are you the buyer: Yes No, if no, then explain that the client is the person paying for the inspection. The client can list any parties on the home inspection report.
I would like the client to be listed with edit option to delete and add option. Everyone listed would have an email address to send the report to. Okay if the email is the same, some spouses share the same email. 
Phone Number 
Inspection Address: (transfer the address over from the insert address information and make it static – grayed out with the city, state and zip code as well) (ask if the address is correct, allow edits)
Square Footage (transfers over) (ask if the square footage is correct, allow edits)
Occupancy Status: Occupied 
Realtor Notification: Do you want your realtor to have a copy before you review the report? If yes, the require realtor’s name and email address.

🔒 Message & Flow Concept
1. Grayed-Out “View Detailed Pricing” Card Until Verified
•	Disable or “gray out” the “View Pricing” button.
•	Show a tooltip or inline message like:
“🔒 To view pricing, please confirm your contact details. This helps us provide accurate estimates tailored to your property.”
